For my SQL case study I wanted to find out more about Covid. I got the up to date data from www.ourworldindata.org
In excel I split the data into two tables; deaths and vaccinations. From there I got to find out alot about the statistics.
I got to find out some information like the highest death count for countries or continents, vaccinations for the United 
States, the percentage of population vs. total cases and more. 

SELECT *
FROM `covid.covid_deaths` 
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 3,4

SELECT *
FROM `covid.covid_vaccinations` 
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 3,4

SELECT location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM `covid.covid_deaths` 
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2

--Looking at Total cases vs. Total Deaths
--Shows the chances of dying if you get covid in your country

SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS death_percentage
FROM `covid.covid_deaths` 
WHERE location LIKE "%States"
ORDER BY 1,2

--Looking at Total Cases vs. Population
--Shows what percentage of population got covid

SELECT location, date, total_cases, population, (total_cases/population)*100 AS covid_percentage
FROM `covid.covid_deaths` 
WHERE location LIKE "%States"
ORDER BY 1,2

--Countries with highest covid rate vs. population

SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS highest_covid_count, MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS covid_percentage
FROM `covid.covid_deaths` 
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY covid_percentage DESC

--Countries with the highest death count per population 

SELECT location, MAX(cast(total_deaths as int)) AS total_death_count
FROM `covid.covid_deaths` 
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY total_death_count DESC

--Grouping death count it by continent

SELECT continent, MAX(cast(total_deaths as int)) AS total_death_count
FROM `covid.covid_deaths` 
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY total_death_count DESC

--Global Numbers

SELECT date, SUM(new_cases) AS total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths AS int)) AS total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths AS int))/SUM(new_cases)*100 AS death_percentage
FROM `covid.covid_deaths` 
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY 1,2

--Total population vs. Vaccinations
--Using CTE

WITH `PopvsVac` (continent, location, date, population, new_vaccinations,rolling_people_vaccinated), AS (
SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations, SUM(cast(vac.new_vaccinations AS int)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS rolling_people_vaccinated
FROM `covid.covid_deaths` dea
JOIN `covid.covid_vaccinations` vac
ON dea.location = vac.location
AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT *, (rolling_people_vaccinated/population)*100
FROM `PopvsVac`


--Temp Table
